    <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core>.
  - Unzip and copy the binaries to a flash drive or
    D:\\DevelopmentFiles\\Dotnet.
  - Optionally add the dotnet directory to your system PATH via `setx
    path "%path%;D:\\DotnetPath"` using SSH.
  - Execute your dotnet core software via "dotnet program.exe" using SSH
    in the dotnet diectory (or anywhere if you updated your PATH).

  The system cannot find the file specified | If running your dotnetcore software on an external drive, move it to an internal one such as D: or T:

## SysInternals

Sysinternals provide a suite of nice tools to look for possible misconfigured states or inner workings of the system.

For example:

* Listing active HANDLEs
* Listing loaded ddls
* Listing active Volumes (incl. hidden / unmounted)
* Checking access control of files/registry/pipes etc.
* ...

Here is just a quick reminder how to deploy it.

### Download

Download: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite

Fetch:

* Sysinternals Suite
* Sysinternals Suite for Nano Server

Extract each to their own folder on the console.

### Accept the EULA via reg key

Normally each tool requires the additional argument `-accepteula` on the commandline - on each call!

Instead, execute this in powershell just once:
`New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\Software\Sysinternals' -Name 'EulaAccepted' -Value '1' -PropertyType DWORD -Force`

Profit!
