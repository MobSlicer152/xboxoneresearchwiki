# Welcome
Welcome to the Xbox One Research wiki\!

This is a place where information about the Xbox One console can be
shared. Progress is currently slow, but we will be adding information when we can.

See the [FAQ](faq.md) for frequently asked questions.

Also check out the [Blog](https://xboxoneresearch.github.io/)!

## Repair

If you are looking for repair information / failure diagnostics, check out the [POST Code page](./hardware/post.md).

## Contributing

How can you help?

As we are currently mostly focussing on the software development part to make the retail exploits more user-friendly, we are clearly lacking behind on the wiki...

We appreciate any support!

If you are unsure which topic is up for grabs, contact us on [Matrix chat](#community) or visit the Wiki's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/xboxoneresearch/wiki/issues).

If you are new to (Git)hub and want to learn how the contribution flow works -> [click here](https://github.com/xboxoneresearch/wiki/issues) for the README.

## Important

We do our best to ensure that we are respectful towards the research
conducted on the Xbox One and Series. However, if there is any issues we are open
for discussion and will work with Microsoft accordingly.
